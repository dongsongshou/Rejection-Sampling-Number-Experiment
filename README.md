# Rejection-Sampling-Number-Experiment
We conducted a rejection sampling experiment for the article "Comments on “A Non-Interactive Identity-Based Multi-Signature Scheme on Lattices with Public Key Aggregation”" using SageMath 10.7.
Readers can change the parameters to conduct their own experiments. The current code uses the Toy parameters (m=4, q=16, and sigma=2).

Below are the code execution results:
Theoretical M = 103.75;
Experimental avg iterations: 88.4;
Theoretical expectation: 103.8;
Relative error: 14.8%.
